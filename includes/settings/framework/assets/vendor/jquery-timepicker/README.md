jQuery UI Timepicker by François Gélinas
========================================

What
----
This is a jQuery UI time picker plugin build to match with other official jQuery UI widgets.
Based on the existing date picker, it will blend nicely with your form and use your selected jQuery UI theme.
The plugin is very easy to integrate in your form for you time (hours / minutes) inputs.

Why
---
I built this plugin because I could not find a plugin that did what I needed.

Doc
---
Examples are available on the main page at [http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker](http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker)
Most option parameters are documented at [http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/#usage](http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/#usage)

Requirements

Work with jQuery 1.5.1 and more, also require jQuery UI core.
