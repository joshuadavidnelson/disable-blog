Bug reports are a vital way to help make the plugin better for you and for others. **If you have found a security vulnerability, please [contact the developer directly](mailto:josh@joshuadnelson.com).**

- **Translations** - The effort to localize strings on the plugin is entirely a volunteer effort, and these contributions have a huge impact on the plugin's accessibility. Thank you to our translators! Learn more about how you can contribute [here](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/).

Feel free to test [current pull requests](https://github.com/joshuadavidnelson/disable-blog/pulls/) and leave comments, or test the current version locally with the newest version of WordPress or your own plugin. We are strongly in favor of Cross Plugin Integration - being compatible with as many other plugins as possible!
