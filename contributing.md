The `master` branch is reserved for releases and intended to be a mirror of the official current release, or `trunk` on wp.org.

The `develop` branch is the most current working branch.

All pull requestes should be branches specific to a single issue or feature, directed to the `develop` branch. All improvements are merged into `develop` and then queued up for release before being merged into `master`.
