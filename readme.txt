All the power of WordPress, without a blog.

== Description ==

Build a blog-less WordPress site.

Disable Blog is a comprehensive plugin to disable the built-in blogging functionality on your site. You'll be free to use pages and custom post types without the burden of a blog.

The blog is "disabled" when the plugin is activated, which removes support for the core 'post' type, hides blog-related admin pages/settings, and redirects urls on both the public and admin portions of the site. Refer to the [GitHub readme file](https://github.com/joshuadavidnelson/disable-blog/#how-does-this-plugin-work) for a detailed functionality list.

= Important =

**You need to select a page to act as the home page**. If Settings > Reading > "Front Page Displays" is not set to show a page, then this plugin will not function correctly. Not doing so will mean that your post page can still be visible on the front-end of the site. It's not required, but it is recommended you select a page for the  "posts page" setting, this page will be automatically redirected to the static "home page."

= Site Content & Data =

This plugin will not delete any of your site's data, however existing blog related content will not be accessible while this plugins is active. This includes posts, categories, tags, and related comments.

If you have content and wish to remove it, either delete that content prior to activation or deactivate this plugin, delete it, and re-active.

= Comments =

Comments remain enabled, unless the 'post' type is the only type supporting comments (pages also support comments by default, so the comments section won't disappear in most cases). If you're looking to disable comments more thoroughly, check out the [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) plugin.

= Categories & Tags =

These are disabled unless they are supported by a custom post type.

= Custom Post Types =

This plugin includes extensive support for custom post types and taxonomies. If you are using a custom post type that supports the built-in `category` and/or `post_tag` taxonomies, they will be visible and accessible through that post type.

= Support =

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Add the plugin viw Plugins > Add New, or manually upload the `disable-blog` plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Disable Comments? =

Other post types (like Pages) may have comment support and other great plugins exist that can disable comments, so this feature was not part of the initial development of this plugin. A future release will include options to disable comments, but until then if you would like to disable comments, try the [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) plugin.

= I want to delete my posts and comments. =

Deactivate the plugin, delete your posts (which will delete related comments), and delete any tags or categories you might want to remove as well. Then reactivate the Disable Blog to hide everything again.

= How can I disable author archives? =

Author archives are automatically created by WordPress for every user (example url: `example.com/author/author-name`. Typically these archives show posts by that user and possibly they biographical information. So many plugins and themes use author archives for other purposes - account page, profile page, etc. For that reason disabling author archives is currently only available with this plugin via a filter.

If you're not using the built-in WP author archives for other purposes and would like to disable them entirely, add the following to your theme functions.php file or a custom plugin file:

`add_filter( 'dwpb_disable_author_archives', '__return_true' );`.

If author archives are not disabled, the plugin adds functionality to support custom post types on author archives by passing an array of post type slugs to `dwpb_author_archive_post_types` filter - however, theme support is usually needed to disable custom content types correctly.

= How can I change the plugin's behavior? =

There are numerous filters available to change the way this plugin works. Refer to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/joshuadavidnelson/disable-blog/) for more details or reach out on the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/disable-blog/) if you have any questions.

= 0.5.0 =

**New**

- Add disable author archive functionality via new `dwpb_disable_author_archives` filter. Pass `true` to disable author archives entirely. Default does not disable author archives because numerous other plugins use author archives for other purposes. (A future settings page will provide more flexibility here).
- Add `dwpb_author_archive_post_types` filter to provide author archive support for custom post types. Pass an array of post type slugs to this filter to modify the post types queried on author archives, if not removed by filter above.
- Add `dwpb_disabled_xmlpc_methods` filter to extend the methods being disabled by the plugin. Pass `false` to remove the functionality entirely. Closes #50
- Remove user sitemaps unless author archives are supported by custom post types via the filter noted above.
- Replace the "Posts" column on the user admin screen by a "Pages" column, also adds similar columns for custom post types using the filter noted above.
- Remove the "view" link to author archives in the user screen if author archives are not supported.
- Update the post tag and category "count" columns to correctly show the number of posts by post type, for use with custom post types supporting built-in taxonomies.
- Update the customizer "Homepage" view to match the Reading options page view, when homepage is set.
- Update the default posts page admin notice indicating the blog is redirected.
- New `dwpb_pass_query_string_on_redirect` filter, returning `true` enables all valid url query params to be passed during redirects. Default is false. Use the `dwpb_allowed_query_vars` to limit the vars passed in the redirect by passing an array of keys (e.g. return array( 'utm' ) to only pass utm query variables in the query string). Closes #52
- Add javascript to hide admin screen items not easily selected by CSS, include:
	- Hiding toggle comment link on welcome screen (if they are not supported by other post types),
	- Hiding the category and tag permalink base options (if not supported by other post types), and
	- Hiding the default category & default post format on Writing options page.

**Fixes**

- Bring back some admin page redirects to account for use cases where direct access to `post.php`, `post-new.php`, etc occur. Closes #45.
- Replace the REST API site health check (which uses the `post` type) with a matching function using the `page` endpoint instead. This was throwing an error with the `post` type REST endpoints are disabled. Closes #46.
- Fix issue with Reading Settings link in admin notice outputting raw HTML instead of a link. Closes #47.
- In order to account for multiple subpages of a common parent page being removed the `dwpb_menu_subpages_to_remove` param has been updated to support an array of subpages in the format of `$remove_subpages['parent-page-slug.php'] = array( 'subpage-1.php', 'subpage-2.php' );`, though it still supports subpages as strings for backwards compatibility. Fixes bugs were `options-writing.php` and `options-discussion.php` were conflicting.

**Improvements/Updates**

- Update admin filters to a common format and removing redundent filters. Filter changes include:
	- New filter: `dwpb_redirect_admin_url` filters the final url used in admin redirects.
	- `dwpb_redirect_admin` only accepts 1 parameter, the previous version accepted 3 (dropping `$redirect_url` & `$current_url`).
	- `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_post` is now `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit`.
	- `dwpb_redirect_single_post_edit` is now `dwpb_redirect_admin_post`.
	- `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_single_post` is now `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit`.
	- `dwpb_redirect_edit_tax` has been removed. Use `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_tags` or `dwpb_redirect_admin_term` instead, depending on the context.
	- `dwpb_redirect_edit_comments` has been removed. use `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_comments` instead.
	- `dwpb_redirect_options_discussion` has been removed. Use `dwpb_redirect_admin_options_discussion` instead.
	- The filter `dwpb_redirect_admin_options_writing` that would pass a boolean to toggle off the options writing page has been remaned `dwpb_remove_options_writing` and must be passed with `true` in order to have the page redirect _and_ the admin menu item removed. By default the value filtered is false and the options Writing page does not go away, as numerous other plugins use this page for non-blog related settings. Now `dwpb_redirect_admin_options_writing` is used to filter the redirect url itself, replacing the previously named `dwpb_redirect_options_writing` filter.
	- `dwpb_redirect_options_tools` has been removed. Use `dwpb_redirect_admin_options_tools` instead.
	- New filter: `dwpb_disabled_xmlpc_methods` (see above).
	- New filter: `dwpb_author_archive_post_types` (see above).
	- New filter: `dwpb_disable_author_archives` (see above).
- Update public redirect filters to match the pattern used for the new admin redirects. Filer changes include:
	- New filter: `dwpb_front_end_redirect_url` filters the final url used in front end redirects.
	- New filter: `dwpb_redirect_author_archive` to change the redirect used on author archives, if they are disabled.
	- New filter: `dwpb_disable_user_sitemap` to change the user sitemap default, pass `true` to keep disable the sitmap. Note that if author archives are disabled by the above filter, user sitemps will be as well.
	- `dwpb_redirect_posts` is now `dwpb_redirect_post`.
	- `dwpb_redirect_post_{$post->ID}` filter has been removed. Use `dwpb_redirect_post` and check for the post id to target a specific post.
	- `dwpb_redirect_front_end` only accepts 1 parameter, the previous version accepted 3 (dropping `$redirect_url` & `$current_url`).
- Bump minimum PHP to 5.6.
- Tested up to WP Core version 5.9.3.
- Updated minimum WP Core version to 4.0.
- Updated translation file for all current plugin strings.

= 0.4.10 =
- Fix a bug from v0.4.9 that caused redirects on custom post type archives, correcting the `modify_query` function to only remove posts from built-in taxonomy archives, as that was the original intent.

= 0.4.9 =
- **Notice:** We've added the minimum PHP version requirement of 5.3, which was not explicitly set before now.
- **Big change:** the plugin now changes the `post_type` arguments for posts so they are no longer public and removes all post_type support parameters. This disables the post-related admin redirects, as WordPress will now show users an error page stating "Sorry, you are not allowed to edit posts in this post type." It also pulls posts out of a lot of other locations (menus, etc) and is a much more efficient method of "disabling" the post type. This method is also used on built-in taxonomies, unless another post type supports them. **This change may impact other plugins or themes, be sure to back up your site and, if you can, test these changes prior to updating the plugin on a production site.**
- Disable pingbacks entirely.
- Fix comment redirect/menu functionality, now correctly removes comments and redirects `edit-comments.php` admin page if no other post type support comments (note that WordPress default is for pages and attachments to support comments).
- Disable XMLRPC for posts and tags/categories. Tag/categories remain if another post type supports them.
- Add basic static php tests and update code to pass those test. Huge props to @szepeviktor.
- Initiate plugin via hook into `plugins_loaded`.
- Change the admin notice related to blog and home page settings, only showing notices if no homepage is set or if the blog and homepage are the same page.
- Flush rewrite rules at activation and deactivation.
- Filtering out `post` post types from all archives, previously it was just author archives and search results.
- Removes post, category, and tag options from all menus. Tag/categories remain if another post type supports them.
- Remove header feed urls, unless supported by another post type.
- WordPress 5.5 support:
	- Remove 'post' post type from XML sitemaps.
	- Remove built-in taxonomies from XML sitemaps, if not being used by a custom post type.
	- Fix sitemap redirect issues.
- **Developers:** Filters were removed and altered in this version:
	- The `dwpb_redirect_feeds` filter now has (3) params, to match those in the `dwpb_disable_feed` filter: $bool, $post, $is_comment_feed.
	- The `dwpb_author_post_types` filter is now `dwpb_archive_post_types`, as the query modification now includes all pages passing `is_archive`.
	- Removed filters: `dwpb_disable_rest_api`, `dwpb_remove_post_comment_support`, `dwpb_remove_post_trackback_support`, `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_single_post`, `dwpb_redirect_single_post_edit`, `dwpb_redirect_admin_edit_post`, `dwpb_redirect_edit`, `dwpb_redirect_admin_post_new`, `dwpb_redirect_post_new` as these are rendered obsolete by above changes.
